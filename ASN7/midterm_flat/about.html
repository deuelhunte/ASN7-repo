      <h2>Who I Am</h2>
      <p>Music has always been at the centre of my life. From experimenting with early recordings on a cassette tape to building a makeshift studio in my bedroom, I’ve learned to appreciate both the art and the science of making music. This website is my canvas for sharing that enthusiasm with you.</p>
      <p>I divide my time between three creative pursuits:&nbsp;songwriting, audio engineering and recording. Each discipline feeds into the other and helps me create richer, more authentic soundscapes.</p>
