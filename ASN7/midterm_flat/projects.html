        <!-- Project 1: Songwriting -->
        <div class="project-item">
          <h3>Original Songwriting</h3>
          <p>I write original songs that tell stories, express emotions and explore new melodies. My writing process involves journaling ideas, experimenting with chord progressions and refining lyrics until they feel honest.</p>

        <!-- Project 2: Audio Engineering -->
        <div class="project-item">
          <h3>Mixing &amp; Audio Engineering</h3>
          <p>Once the song is written, I move to the mix console. I adjust levels, apply equalisation and compression, and fine‑tune effects to bring clarity and balance. My goal is to enhance the emotional impact without over‑processing the music.</p>

        <!-- Project 3: Home Recording -->
        <div class="project-item">
          <h3>Home Recording</h3>
          <p>I track vocals and instruments in my home studio. Recording at home allows me to experiment with arrangements and capture performances whenever inspiration strikes. The technology now available makes professional‑quality production more accessible than ever.</p>
